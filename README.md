[**FDRCLIM**](https://rstudio.aws.science.psu.edu:3838/aaf11/FDRCLIM/) (https://rstudio.aws.science.psu.edu:3838/aaf11/FDRCLIM/) is an SHINY component of [**Arabidopsis CLIMtools**](http://www.personal.psu.edu/sma3/CLIMtools.html) (http://www.personal.psu.edu/sma3/CLIMtools.html) implementing the qvalue R package, adapted from the app created by Andrew Bass. This tool allows to explore the FDR of the ExG associations that can be studied in CLIMGeno and GenoCLIM. The qvalue R package is by John Storey et al. and can be found at Bioconductor's repository: qvalue package

In order to use this application:

1. Choose the ExG association of interest

2. It is then possible to modify the settings that are used to estimate q-values with the various options on the side panel. See the 'Help' tab in the application or see the user manual for the qvalue package by John D. Storey and Andrew J. Bassfor explanations of these options.

3. To view useful visualizations of the results refer to the 'Figures' tab for plots produced by qvalue package. Allow enough time for calculations and plot redering. When you are finished with your analysis, you may click the 'Download Output' button to save your results.
